77,one of the tourist attractions in magetan which is quite famous indeed if you come here you have to make an effort when the weather is favorable because if you are from the west you will pass the road going up which is very foggy if the weather doesn t support the fog from around the tawangmangu area to sarangan lake   motorbike trips are the most exciting and cool when the weather it s foggy especially before passing tawangmangu wonderpark where the road isn t too wide and there are lots of cargo vehicles in the sarangan lake when there happens to be a weekday so it s pretty quiet and the motorbike can get to the place it s cool  good seasoning in my opinion   those who are there can take a speedboat rb x rounds or rb x rounds you can also ride a horse rb x rounds in my opinion one round this lake is long enough so you won t be impressed for a while if you ride a horse there are many inns around the lake     the entrance ticket price is   people  not including parking  just try it on weekdays because it s quieter and motorbikes can go inside because it s not crowded   access from jogja  i think it s quite easy to follow with google maps  to tawangmangu to the location i can say the road from the west route is quite good   the place is clean on weekdays there is quite comfortable to just take photos or enjoy the atmosphere of the lake   be careful from morning to evening the monkeys often come down to look for food even though they are said to be not dangerous but take care of your belongings because sometimes they can be stolen,Positif
78,my intention was to go to serangan  uh  the fog was thick  okay  fortunately  when i entered  it was free again  because the ticket counter was empty  maybe because of the fog  but when i saw the ticket prices  which were thousands of people  in my opinion  it was really expensive  not to mention the depot  so those around sarangan soto  thousand  that s okay  this is still i tolerate it because the soto is delicious  the thousand roasted corn is still understandable because you don t come here every day  right  for sure  if you want to go to serangan  make sure to check the weather first so you don t regret it,Positif

86,i came here not planned  aka impromptu  after an invitation from madiun  my friends invited me to come here  because all of us needed to come home until here  that afternoon to the afternoon  the weather was really cold  but it was really cool  it was really crowded  because on sunday  each person entered the car park  i think i forgot  how many people are selling at the length of the edge of the lake  the lake is very wide  if you want to go around walking  you will be tired  you can rent a horse x rounds  you can also take a boat  you can take a boat for people and the driver per person  you pay   rupiah so the boat is   so the driver will be stopped by writing on the nesting lake and in the photo  you can also go around the lake for quite a long time and sometimes you are invited to speed  for those who are afraid of water  you can ask to go slowly  but it s safe  you don t have to go up hahaha for motorbikes and cars  you can park near the lake  but for the bus it s a bit far so you have to walk so that you can get to the lake around here  there are also many inns that can be for staycation with family or partner or camping can also have toilet and prayer room facilities,Positif

267,okay  this holiday  because it s my first time here  so i ll tell you about the road conditions first  for road conditions  when it s less than a minute to get to the location of the lake  the way up and down is pretty decent  it s a bit like the malang cangar road  so for friends who are also the first time  for my friend s consideration  i brought it livina s old car is of course front drive because i have a lot of family and friends but small cars  so with strict selection  adults are finally selected  children who go with passengers that much  thank god  the net goes up and down smoothly on gears  the engine before leaving and more importantly check the brakes  how come it felt like earlier the downtime was a bit steep as if someone was pushing it  so people entered the ticket location but earlier it seems like the children weren t counted by the ticket guards because this was together with the nataru holiday so the situation seemed very busy so the parking lot was close the location is full  in the end you can park about meters from the location of the car parking fee  but there are lots of parking locations  so you don t have to worry about entering the location  as i said earlier  it s crowded  it s cool  the scenery is a little foggy  and for friends who come from far away and are tired  just want to stay  lots of lodging and the hotel is here  but i don t know the rates  because i m in the bpjs bag category  so it s better to stay at a relative s place  which happens to be a minute from here  so the price  in my opinion  is normal  for example k portion rabbit satay or make sure to ask the price before ordering so that unwanted things don t happen about the price after eating for coffee tea a little more expensive than where i am here because the glass is small but it is still very reasonable for the size of a tourist location okay in the meantime my short lecture about the tourist location of the magetan lake nest  greetings,Positif

319,i ve been to the sarangan lake x and in my opinion there are pluses and minuses when visiting the sarangan lake tourist attraction plus the view is good  lots of food and drink sellers while chatting on the edge of the lake while eating pecel  great lots of lodging so if you want to stay after walking around the lake  you can really have it  daily lodging and renting villas can also sell lots of souvenirs but have never bought one  you can ride a speed boat and ride a horse  if you are in sarangan  how much does it cost  forget about the last boarding time  when playing a speed boat  don t forget to use a life jacket for safety  minus the guardrails surrounding the lake is really low  so for example  there is a small child running and running without the supervision of his parents  he keeps slipping into the lake  okay bye bye  i don t understand why the fence is so low  even though it dives once  it s scary  you know  even though there s a police station near there  but i think it would be safer if the fence is raised  there are some monkeys there  you don t know if they are aggressive or not  but you can also be more careful when carrying things  who knows the monkeys want to be nosy  that s all the experience when playing at sarangan lake  hopefully in the future it will be even better  especially on the guardrail around the lake thank you,Positif
